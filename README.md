Instructions 

Write a console application that does the following: 

1. Ask the user what year, month and day they were born. (can use multiple inputs if you wish)

2. Calculate how many years old the user is based on the current date. Note that you must get the current date using the framework. 

3. Say “Happy Birthday” to the user once for each year old they are. For example, if the user is 20 years old then print Happy Birthday to the console 20 times.
